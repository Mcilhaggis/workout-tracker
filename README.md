# Workout-Tracker

## About the Project
In this assignment I was tasked with creating a "Fitness Tracker" that enables a user to add workouts as a part of their daily schedule. With this application, users are able to add new exercises and view their stats using the built in dashboard. 

This project used the following technologies: **MongoDb, Heroku, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Node Express, Travis-CI, Mongodb Atlas, Mongoose and Morgan**

## Installation
Simply clone the repository and run `npm install ` in your terminal.

This will create the node modules folder you will need in order for this application to function correctly.

## Usage
In order to get this application to run you must open up the terminal and enter the following:

`node server.js`
The application will then console log the url in the terminal that you will need to access the application.

Server listening on: http://localhost:8080 then this into a browser of your choice.
